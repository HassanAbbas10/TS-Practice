# My TypeScript Learning Journey



Welcome to my TypeScript learning journey! This repository contains my practice projects, code snippets, and notes as I learn and explore TypeScript. I am excited to share my progress and insights with you.

## About Me

I am passionate about web development and currently transitioning from front-end to full-stack development. As part of my journey, I am learning TypeScript to improve my coding skills and develop more robust applications.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that brings static typing and other advanced features to the language. It helps catch errors early, improves code readability, and makes large codebases easier to manage.

## Learning Goals

- Understand TypeScript basics and advanced features
- Integrate TypeScript into existing JavaScript projects
- Build robust and scalable applications using TypeScript
- Improve code quality and maintainability

## Coding GIFs

Here are some coding GIFs that illustrate my learning process:

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I am working on:

### Project 1: To-Do List App

A simple to-do list application built with TypeScript and React.

### Project 2: TypeScript Basics

A collection of code snippets and examples demonstrating TypeScript basics.

### Project 3: Advanced TypeScript Features

Exploring advanced TypeScript features such as generics, decorators, and more.
